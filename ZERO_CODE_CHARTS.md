## **üéØ For You (Developer):**

### **Method 1: Command Line (Super Fast)**
```bash
# Add a new chart in 30 seconds!
npm run add-chart "Sales by Region" "SELECT region as name, SUM(amount) as value FROM sales GROUP BY region" "bar"

npm run add-chart "User Status" "SELECT status as name, COUNT(*) as value FROM users GROUP BY status" "pie"

npm run add-chart "Monthly Trend" "SELECT FORMAT(date, 'yyyy-MM') as name, COUNT(*) as value FROM events GROUP BY FORMAT(date, 'yyyy-MM') ORDER BY name" "line"
```

### **Method 2: API Call (For Integration)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/charts/add \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "sales-by-region",
    "name": "Sales by Region", 
    "type": "bar",
    "sql": "SELECT region as name, SUM(amount) as value FROM sales GROUP BY region"
  }'
```

### **Method 3: Direct Code (If Needed)**
```typescript
// In your service initialization
ChartRegistryService.addChart({
  id: 'custom-chart',
  name: 'Custom Chart',
  type: 'bar',
  sql: 'SELECT category as name, COUNT(*) as value FROM table GROUP BY category'
});
```

## **üé® For Your Client:**

### **Frontend Usage (Zero Code)**
```tsx
// Just use this component - it automatically loads ALL charts!
import { AutoDashboard } from '@/components/shared/AutoDashboard'

export default function ClientDashboard() {
  return (
    <AutoDashboard 
      title="Client Dashboard"
      description="All your charts in one place"
    />
  )
}
```

### **API Endpoints (Automatic)**
- `GET /api/charts/dashboard` - Get all charts
- `GET /api/charts/:chartId` - Get specific chart
- `POST /api/charts/add` - Add new chart
- `GET /api/charts/list` - List all charts

---

## **üìä Chart Types Supported**

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `bar` | Bar chart | Comparisons, categories |
| `pie` | Pie chart | Proportions, percentages |
| `line` | Line chart | Trends over time |
| `area` | Area chart | Cumulative data |
| `scatter` | Scatter plot | Correlations |

---

## **üîß SQL Requirements**

### **Required Fields:**
Your SQL must return:
- `name` or `x` field for X-axis
- `value` or `y` field for Y-axis

### **Date Filtering:**
Include `{dateFilter}` for automatic date filtering:
```sql
SELECT category as name, COUNT(*) as value 
FROM your_table 
WHERE 1=1 {dateFilter}  -- This gets replaced with date conditions
GROUP BY category
```

### **Example SQL Patterns:**

**1. Count by Category:**
```sql
SELECT category as name, COUNT(*) as value
FROM your_table 
WHERE 1=1 {dateFilter}
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```

**2. Sum by Department:**
```sql
SELECT department_name as name, SUM(amount) as value
FROM your_table 
WHERE 1=1 {dateFilter}
GROUP BY department_name
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
```

**3. Average by Month:**
```sql
SELECT FORMAT(created_date, 'yyyy-MM') as name, AVG(score) as value
FROM your_table 
WHERE 1=1 {dateFilter}
GROUP BY FORMAT(created_date, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY name
```

## **‚ö° Real Examples**

### **Example 1: Sales Dashboard**
```bash
# Add sales by region
npm run add-chart "Sales by Region" "SELECT region as name, SUM(amount) as value FROM sales WHERE 1=1 {dateFilter} GROUP BY region ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC" "bar"

# Add monthly sales trend
npm run add-chart "Monthly Sales Trend" "SELECT FORMAT(sale_date, 'yyyy-MM') as name, SUM(amount) as value FROM sales WHERE 1=1 {dateFilter} GROUP BY FORMAT(sale_date, 'yyyy-MM') ORDER BY name" "line"

# Add product category distribution
npm run add-chart "Product Categories" "SELECT category as name, COUNT(*) as value FROM products WHERE 1=1 {dateFilter} GROUP BY category" "pie"
```

### **Example 2: User Analytics**
```bash
# Add user registration by month
npm run add-chart "User Registrations" "SELECT FORMAT(created_at, 'yyyy-MM') as name, COUNT(*) as value FROM users WHERE 1=1 {dateFilter} GROUP BY FORMAT(created_at, 'yyyy-MM') ORDER BY name" "line"

# Add user status distribution
npm run add-chart "User Status" "SELECT status as name, COUNT(*) as value FROM users WHERE 1=1 {dateFilter} GROUP BY status" "pie"

# Add user activity by hour
npm run add-chart "Activity by Hour" "SELECT DATEPART(hour, last_login) as name, COUNT(*) as value FROM users WHERE last_login IS NOT NULL AND 1=1 {dateFilter} GROUP BY DATEPART(hour, last_login) ORDER BY name" "bar"
```

## **üìù Notes**

- For production, consider persisting charts in database
